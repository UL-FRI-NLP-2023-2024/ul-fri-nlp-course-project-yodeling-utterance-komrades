# Sources: `Unsupervised Domain adaptation for Sentence Classification`

This directory contains the entire source code of this project. Currently, it contains the baseline evaluation scripts and definitions of the baseline neural network.

To modify the parameters of the training/testing process or the classifier's parameters, simply modify the values in the config dictionary in the `baseline_run.py` file.
